### JSPILcdDriver in 2019
A 16x2 LCD library for the Raspberry pi, written in Javascript. <br/>
There were only LCD libraries for python, but for some reason I started to implement my own in JS, using LCD-s [instruction set](https://mil.ufl.edu/4744/docs/lcdmanual/commands.html). <br/>
Decided to document it and add some examples.

### Virus in 2020
A small game, where you have to insert a usb stick into a computer, to win against viruses wanting to infect you. <br/>
Was made coming from military service to recall some Java, before going to university.
